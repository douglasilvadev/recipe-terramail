Ferdi Recipe for Terra Mail 
## What are "Recipes"?

Recipes are small scripts that are responsible for providing the connection between your services (e.g. WhatsApp, GMail or Slack) and Ferdi. It provides Ferdi information like the number of current notifications, handles enabling dark mode and may otherwise improve your experience with the service.

Each time you create a new service inside Ferdi, Ferdi will automatically install and execute the recipe associated with that service.

## Creating and adding your own recipes

Please refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/blob/master/docs/integration.md)
